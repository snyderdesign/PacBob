# PacSplore the Cave
I have always envisioned this new version of pacman to be a side-scrolling adventure that has levels.  Random levels, but in order to do that I need to add a few thingsâ€¦

## Phase 1:
1. Centered scrolling canvas
2. snake-drawing map-creator
3. finish-line end-game script

## Phase 2:
1. Perm-Power-ups
2. Storable items
3. a bunch of enemy types

## Phase 3:
1. audio
2. better graphics
