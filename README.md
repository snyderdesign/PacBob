# PacBob
A version of Pacman, except with tiny little bob-heads and the map is randomly generated!

# List of things to develop
1. Load screen
2. centered content
3. HTML5 integration
4. walk vs standing animation for the players
5. animation for the ghosts
6. Refactor collision between sprites
7. create a json file containing the sprites and how the interact
8. change the coins from being map-objects to being independent objects
9. refactor the collision between non-map objects to be for everything
10. change the map from a map to a grid.

# PacSplore the Cave
I have always envisioned this new version of pacman to be a side-scrolling adventure that has levels.  Random levels, but in order to do that I need to add a few thingsâ€¦

## Phase 1:
1. Centered scrolling canvas
2. snake-drawing map-creator
3. finish-line end-game script

## Phase 2:
1. Perm-Power-ups
2. Storable items
3. a bunch of enemy types

## Phase 3:
1. audio
2. better graphics
